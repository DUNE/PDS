## Simple Waveform Plots
`simple_waveform_plots.py` makes use of `pdstools` to plot the waveforms for a single channel on a given HDF5 file. The resulting plots appear as pages on a PDF file. For usage details, do `python simple_waveform_plots.py --help`. This script is intended to be an example for how `pdstools` can be used.
